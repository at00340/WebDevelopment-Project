                <h1>Mana</h1>
                <p>
                    Mana is essential to not only rogues magic system but also its gameplay. mana can be obtained in two ways: you can
                    be hit with a curse spell or you can hit any entity in the game 100 
                    times. once obtained, you are given a random mana color and a mana bar will be added to your screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mana is displayed in games as a small bar that can be charged. The speed at which your mana bar charges is initially slow,
                    but this can be trained by continously filling your bar to 100%
                </p>
            </div>

            

            <div class="information-divider">
                <h1>Mana Abilities</h1>
                <h2>Mana Climb</h2>
                    <p>
                        once mana is obtained, the player gains the ability to mana climb. this allows this to stick to verticle surfaces in game
                        and climb them. It should be noted that as the player hangs on whatever surface they are on, their mana bar will drain until it
                        hits 0 and the user will fall. the rate that your mana bar depletes can be trained by continously climbing.
                    </p>

                <h2>Mana Dash</h2>
                <p>
                    if the player has been in game for a total of one hour and has their mana trained to the maximum, the gain the ability to mana dash.
                    this allows the player to dash further when mana is in their bar and is indicated by a special noise when dashing along with a special visual.  
                </p>

                <h2>Mana punching</h2>
                <p>
                    once the player gains mana, they are able to charge their mana and punch, creating a mana punch. Mana punches dont do
                    extra damage but hitting someone with a mana punch will disable their mana charge for a short period of time. mana
                    punching also trains your mana.
                </p>
           
                <h2>Mana Running</h2>
                <p>
                    once the player has mana, they gain the ability to mana run. When there is mana in the players mana bar and they attemp to run, the move
                    significantly faster than normal. Mana running also leaves a small trail of mana behind you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="information-divider">
                <h1>Magic</h1>

                <p>
                    In Rogues magic system, there are of course, spells. Spells in rogue are obtained through finding scrolls around the map and learning their contents,
                    giving your character the ability to use the magic within them. When casting spells, the player must utilize their mana bar at the right percent in order
                    to cast the spell properly. if the player casts the spell in the wrong percentiles, the spell will backfire. this usually results in inflicitng the spells damage
                    or negative effects on oneself. in some cases, it can even result in  death. Regular spells are also always casted through handsigns. some spells have longer 
                    handsigns than others, and players must obtain a skill to cast these handsigns faster
                </p>

                <h2>Spell Types</h2>

                <p>
                        in rogue all spells are not created equal! Spells have their own categories and uses. here is a list of the different spell types and what they mean:
                    

                        <div class="bullet-point-title">God Spells:</div> <li class="content">Rarer and exclusive spells that can only be learned by super class mages and above.</li>
                        <div class="bullet-point-title">Curse Spells:</div> <li class="content">Spells that have the ability to give players mana.</li>
                        <div class="bullet-point-title">Snap Spells:</div> <li class="content">After a Spell is trained enough, you gain the ability to use its instant-cast variant</li>
                </p>

                <h2>Spell</h2>
                <p>
                    Spells in rogue are usually obtained through scrolls. some scrolls are only obtained at <a href="../WorldMechanics/Worldmap.html">Skycastle</a> and some
                    can only be obtained through certain quests. 
                </p>
    
    

            </div>
            <div class="information-divider">
                <h1>Snaps</h1>
                <p>
                    Snaps are more advanced forms of regular spells. When you obtain the snap version fo a spell, you gain the ability to cast a different version of the same
                    spell that doesnt use hand sign to cast. These spells well always be different from the original, but not nessicarily better.
                </p>
                <h2>Obtaining</h2>
                <p>
                    Snaps are obtained through casting certain spells a random amount of times. This number is randomized over each wip. You can check whether
                    you can obtain a snap or not by talking to the snap trainer. it costs 250 silver to obtain a snap
                </p>
