            <p>
                Alignment is a vital component of rogues progression. It is a key requirment in the obtainment
                of the players class, and is a defining feature of the games player interactions. Your alignment 
                will also dictate how certain npcs interact with you, and can restrict you from certain area of the 
                game. Most classes that are Super class and above will have a requirment for alignment. It is safe to 
                assumew that every super class requires 30 in one alignment or the other, while ultras requires 60.

            <h1>Orderly</h1>
            <p>
                In Rogue Orderly can be seen as good. You can aquire Orderly in multiple ways,
                but some are far more effective than others. The best way to obtain orderly is through
                drinking potions, or jailing a chaotic player (the community refers to this as rotting since the player
                being jailed will lose a life after a certain time passes)
            </p>

            <h1>Chaotic</h1>
            <p>
                In Rogue, chaotic can be seen as evil. Gaining chaotic can only be done in 3 ways, each giving varying
                amounts. The simplest is to simply kill another player. The second is by taking assasinations; jobs where
                you hunt and kill players who are orderly. Lastly, being a <a href="../PlayerMechanics/races.html">Dinakiri</a>
                and using soul rip, granting you the most amount of chaotic possible.
