            <p>
                Gaia is host to multiple locations, each with their own unique characteristics. There are a total of 5 major locations
                across the map. Rogue lineage has a tempature mechanic in the game and each map location has different climate, making
                some places more friendlier than others.

            <h1>Desert</h1>
            <p>
                Rogues desert is a scortching environment. In this location, the players tempature will constantly go up,
                but this area is not hot enough to harm the player. The desert area has 2 major towns: Renova town and Sentinal.
                while renova is not so different from other towns, the city of centinal holds a powerful secret within its walls
            </p>

            <h1>Emeral Sea</h1>
            <p>
                The emerald sea is an large body of water that divides the desert of Gaia from Royal woods. This area is host to the
                wayside in, one of the most common spawning places for beginning players. In the far west of the emerald shores, the player can
                find a popular <a href="Silver.html">farming spot</a> know as the crypt of kings. Just make sure you bring a tourch! 
            </p>

            <h1>Royal Woods</h1>
            <p>
                Royal woods is a large forest that stands between the Tundra region and the rest of gaia. This is a location where
                many strong players will fight each other to the death, a dangerous place for player that value their lives. It is also home
                to the biggest city in Gaia, Oresfall. While the city is rich with resources and equipment, its backalleys crawl with
                players meaning you harm.
            </p>

            <h1>Deep Forest</h1>
            <p>
                The Deep Forest is an area deep within royal woods where the canopy of trees block out all light. This is one of the more
                dangerous areas of the map, yet also one of the most rewarding. This are has dangerous pitfalls all throughout its woods,
                but past these dangers holds a small town known as flower light where multiple important quest items are located
            </p>

            <h1>Tundra</h1>
            <p>
                The largest, and most deadly location in the game. Tundra shouldnt be a place the player enters unless they are either
                throuroughly prepares, or fairley experienced. located behind the great oresfall gate, the Tundra is where players will spend 
                most of their time endgame. This area has fog thick enough to hinder the players vision, wind cold enough to kill them with
                frostbite, and enemies that will hunt the player down.
            </p>
